Greetings!

My aim is to learn how to build an Android app, and with that to build the Android app.

I'm a seasoned windows admin now and I did not happen to learn more sofisticated programming so far. I was in touch with a little bit of VB and PS, but that was all.

Now I installed Android studio and try to make my way to my self-constructed (Android-)app.

For me I expect a bigger learnimg curve, but on the other hand I think basic features should be possible to realize for me, too.

Finding some mentorship here on github would be nice, especially when things got stuck on the way .. 

Hi level purpose of the app: a companion to enter events into a UI and perform some data requests in the background and combine that into a database. And finally get certain reports from that. Shall make a diabetics life easier.

Open for discussions about code and strategies: a.zern@zern.de

Cheers!
